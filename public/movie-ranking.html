<h1>The Best Movies According to Xoliswa</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies at the moment</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>Strong lead character. The character, John Wick, goes from a grieving husband to seeking revenge for 
the death of his wife and cat - strong character development</p>

<h3>Now You See Me 1 & 2</h3>
<p>I love how magic was used to pull off heists. This makes the movie different from your typical 
crime movies. </p>

<h3>Inside Out</h3>
<p>The movie explores themes, such as emotions and memory, that both children and adults resonate with.
A personification of these emotions offers a unique perspective on how they shape our experiences.</p>
