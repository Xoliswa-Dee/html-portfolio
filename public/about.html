<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  I am Xoliswa Dywili, a 23 year old aspiring software engineer. 
</p>

<p>
  My love for technology started back in 2018, when I was in grade 10, after choosing Computer Application
  Technology (CAT) as one of my preferred subjects. This was my first proper introduction to the world of
  technology. I had no idea what I wanted to be when I grew up, but I knew it had something to do with 
  computers. I pursued my interest in coding at Eduvos, where I completed my Bachelor's degree in Software 
  Engineering.

<p>
  During my university years, I gained experience in programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Java,
  JavaScript, PHP and SQL. These helped me build a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end
  development, enhancing my ability to create responsive web applications. 
</p>

<p>
  I would like to use my technical skills to contribute to projects that drive positive changes. Ultimately,
  I want to take on roles that allow me to mentor upcoming developers and foster collaborative team environments.
